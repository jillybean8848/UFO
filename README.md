# UFO

## Overview
In this challenge we created a table to organize UFO data that is stored in a large JavaScript array. We then created filters to make the table dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input. We then place the table into an HTML file for easier viewing. This table was created using JavaScript as the primary language. JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. JavaScript is also able to provide a high level of customization. HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were also used to modify the design of our website.

## Results:
### Welcome Fellow UFO Enthusiasts :)

You were probably able to notice quickly when viewing our full page screenshot there is quite a bit of content regarding UFO sightings. Luckily, with our filters our users can easily search for specific sightings by typing in the search boxes. Users should type in lower case letters and avoid any spaces at the end of the text. Simply press enter to show the results. To reset the filter, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.

Here is an example of how the search function helps to filter all this data:

## Summary
### Drawbacks:
In order for the search functions to work efficiently our users must inherently know the criteria that is being recorded. Meaning, if they searched for cities, shapes, dates, states or countries that are not part of our data their search results would be blank. There is also no room for error such as capitalizations, spelling, or spacing. 

## Recommendations:
Some updates that could help our site be more user friendly would be the addition of functions that would correct spacing and capitalization errors in order to provide our users with the results they are looking for.
